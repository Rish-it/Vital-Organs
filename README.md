## Project Overview

**Vital-Organs** aims to revolutionize the organ donation process using blockchain technology. By creating a decentralized, secure, and transparent ledger, the project seeks to build trust and transparency in the organ donation system, addressing key concerns of both donors and recipients.

## Problem Statement

The main problem facing organ donation is the lack of trust and transparency in the system. Potential donors are often hesitant to donate their organs due to concerns about how their organs will be used and who will receive them. On the other hand, recipients are often uncertain about the origin and quality of the organs they receive.

## Solution

The use of blockchain technology in organ donation involves the creation of a decentralized, secure, and transparent ledger of all organ donations. This ledger would track the allocation of organs, ensuring that they are allocated fairly and transparently. Potential donors would be identified through a blockchain-based system that collects and shares medical data. This would allow for a standardized approach to identifying potential donors, ensuring that organs are allocated fairly.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:
- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rish-it/Vital-Organs.git
   cd Vital-Organs
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.You may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.See the section about running tests for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about deployment for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
